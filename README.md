# :memo: Description
This project is a shopping cart built using React as part of the Ignite Bootcamp program from [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). The shopping cart is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, with features such as adding and removing items from the cart, updating the cart total, and viewing detailed product information. The project utilizes technologies such as TypeScript, Vite, and Styled Components to create a fast, responsive, and visually appealing shopping cart. With its focus on modern front-end development techniques and best practices, this project is an excellent showcase of React's capabilities and the skills of the developer.
